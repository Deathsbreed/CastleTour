==========

This repo is a combination of a few Irrlicht tutorials.

### Compiling
The [Makefile](/Makefile) for this project is so far only for Debian Linux (it's all I can test it on). Please make sure you have all the necessary libraries, make sure that Irrlicht is in your _LD Path_, and also make sure you have the __clang++ compiler__ installed. Then, simply run the following:
```
$ make
```
The binary should be in the ```bin``` directory.

### Contributing
Feel free to add. This is something I'm using to learn Irrlicht, and it would help if I had a better [Makefile](/Makefile) file that could compile on multiple platforms.

### License
Since this really isn't my code but a combination of multiple Irrlicht tutorials, I have licensed this project under the [Unlicense](/LICENSE), because it's kind of like a tutorial.
