CastleTour
==========

This repo is a combination of a few Irrlicht tutorials.

### Compiling
This project uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and has only been tested on a 32-bit Linux computer. To compile this code install Irrlicht (from the repos) and all other necessary libraries (such as OpenGL) and run the following commands:
```bash
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
Then, in order to run, use the script [castle-tour.sh](/castle-tour.sh) located in the root directory.

### License
Since this really isn't my code but a combination of multiple Irrlicht tutorials, I have licensed this project under the [Unlicense](/LICENSE), because it's kind of like a tutorial.
