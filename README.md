CastleTour
==========

This repo is a combination of a few Irrlicht tutorials.

### Compiling
This project uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and has only been tested on a 32-bit Linux computer. To compile this code install Irrlicht (from the repos) and all other necessary libraries (such as OpenGL) and run the following commands:
```bash
$ cmake .
$ make
```
This should compile the code and you should find a binary in a directory called `bin`. You should be able to run this project from there.

### License
Since this really isn't my code but a combination of multiple Irrlicht tutorials, I have licensed this project under the [Unlicense](/LICENSE), because it's kind of like a tutorial.
